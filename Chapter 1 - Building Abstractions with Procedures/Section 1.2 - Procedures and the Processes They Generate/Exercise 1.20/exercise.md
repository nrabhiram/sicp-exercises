# Exercise 1.20

The process that a procedure generates is of course dependent on the rules used by the interpreter. As an example, consider the iterative `gcd` procedure given above. Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order evaluation, as discussed in Section 1.1.5. (The normal-order evaluation rule for `if` is described in Exercise 1.5.) Using the substitution method (for normal order), illustrate the process generated in evaluating `(gcd 206 40)` and indicate the `remainder` operations that are actually performed. How many `remainder` operations are actually performed in the normal-order evaluation of `(gcd 206 40)`? In the applicative-order evaluation?

# Solution

## Normal-Order Evaluation

Given below is the process generated by the normal-order evaluation of `(gcd 206 40)`.
