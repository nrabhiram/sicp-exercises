# Exercise 2.14

Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate the behavior of the system on a variety of arithmetic expressions. Make some intervals `A` and `B`, and use them in computing the expressions `A/A` and `A/B`. You will get the most insight by using intervals whose width is a small percentage of the center value. Examine the results of the computation in center-percent form (see Exercise 2.12).

# Solution

When we divide an interval by itself, instead of getting exactly 1 as a result, we get an interval whose center is approximately 1, with an uncertainty equivalent to about twice that of the interval's (for widths that are a small percentage of the center value).
