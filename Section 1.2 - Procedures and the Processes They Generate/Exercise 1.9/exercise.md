# Exercise 1.9

Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures `inc`, which increments its argument by `1`, and `dec`, which decrements its argument by `1`.

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`. Are these processes iterative or recursive?

# Solution

For the first procedure

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
```

```
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

The process generated is **linear recursive** due to:

- the chain of deferred `inc` operations built
- the length of the deferred chain of `inc` operations being proportional to `a`, and growing linearly with it

For the second procedure

```scheme
(def (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

```
(+ 4 5)
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
(+ 3 6)
(+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
(+ 2 7)
(+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
(+ 1 8)
(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
(+ 0 9)
9
```

The process generated is **linear iterative** because:

- at any step of the process, its state can be summarized by a fixed number of state variables, 
- a rule exists that describes how the state variables should be updated at each stage of the process, 
- and optionally, an end test could exist that specifies the conditions under which the process should terminate.

The number of steps required in the computation grow linearly with `a`.
