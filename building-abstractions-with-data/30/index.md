Define a procedure `square-tree` analogous to the `square-list` procedure of [Exercise 2.21](exercise-2-21). That is, `square-tree` should behave as follows:

```racket
(square-tree
 (list 1
       (list 2 (list 3 4) 5)
       (list 6 7)))
(1 (4 (9 16) 25) (36 49))
```

Define `square-tree` both directly (i.e., without using any higher-order procedures) and also by using `map` and recursion.
