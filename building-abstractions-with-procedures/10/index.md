The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermann’s function.

```racket
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1) (A x (- y 1))))))
```

What are the values of the following expressions?

```racket
(A 1 10)
(A 2 4)
(A 3 3)
```

Consider the following procedures, where `A` is the procedure defined above:

```racket
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
```

Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the procedures `f`, `g`, and `h` for positive integer values of `n`. For example, `(k n)` computes `5n²`.

## Solution

> In computability theory, the Ackermann function, named after Wilhelm Ackermann, is one of the simplest and earliest-discovered examples of a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive.

— [Wikipedia definition of the Ackermann function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function)

**Total function** means that the function produces a value for all possible inputs in the domain space.

**Computable function** means that the function can be calculated algorithmically.

### Primitive Recursive function

Primitive recursive functions are functions:

- that have a base terminating case,
- the recursion counts down in a predictable way, so you know exactly how many recursive calls will happen, therefore the order of growth with respect to time can be represented as a function of the input size.

### What Makes the Ackermann Function Different?

The order of growth of this function can't be represented as a function of the input size and the result of a recursive call is passed as an argument to another recursive call. Thus, the recursion depth can't be predicted from the inputs alone.
